Thonny version: MicroPython V1.25.0
Webots version: R2025a
Phython version: 3.11.9

Procedure to reproduce results:
1) copy the codes into Thonny, Python, and Webots accordingly
2) connect via WiFi Thonny, get the IP address and connect Webots using the Thonny IP address
3) select in Thonny the coordinate that the robot will travel to
4) check that there is functioning connection between Thonny and Webots, it will say in the terminal
5) run the code from Webots
6) the visuaization code works seperatly. Run the python code twice; the first time it will show the map, the second time will show the path the robot will follow.
